## WL-001 — Worker deployed check skipped before giving auth instructions

**Status:** Open
**Raised:** 2026-03-19
**Type:** Process waste — unnecessary work given

### What happened
Claude gave Rod instructions to create/use Cloudflare API tokens without first checking whether the `ygw-api-proxy` worker was even deployed. Worker was returning 404 — not deployed at all. Auth instructions were irrelevant until deployment is confirmed.

### What it cost
Multiple session interruptions. Rod time wasted on Cloudflare dashboard for no outcome.

### Prevention
Check `https://ygw-api-proxy.leanspirited.workers.dev` first. If 404 → not deployed → fix deployment first before any auth discussion.

---

## WL-002 — New Cloudflare API token created when existing one could have been reused

**Status:** Open
**Raised:** 2026-03-19
**Type:** Unnecessary step — existing credential ignored

### What happened
Claude instructed Rod to create a new Cloudflare API token. The Cusslab worker (`cusslab-api.leanspirited.workers.dev`) is already deployed and working, meaning a valid Cloudflare API token already exists and was used previously. Claude did not check for this before sending Rod to create a new one.

### What it cost
Time in Cloudflare dashboard (dash.cloudflare.com). Confusion. Broken session.

### Prevention
Before any Cloudflare auth step: ask "Do you have the token you used for Cusslab?" If yes — use it. Never send Rod to create a new one unless the existing one is confirmed missing or expired.

---

## WL-003 — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret status checked via wrangler without token set

**Status:** Open
**Raised:** 2026-03-19
**Type:** Tool failure — wrong order of operations

### What happened
Claude ran `wrangler secret list` without `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` set in environment. This always fails in non-interactive mode. Wasted a command, surfaced an error that confused the situation.

### What it cost
A confusing error message. Risk of sending Rod down another wrong path.

### Prevention
Before running ANY wrangler command: confirm `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is set in the terminal. If not set — ask Rod for it first. One check, saves every downstream failure.

---

## WL-004 — Session interrupted mid-deployment, no state saved

**Status:** Open
**Raised:** 2026-03-19
**Type:** Process waste — lost progress

### What happened
Session was interrupted before the YGW worker was deployed. No shared-session-state.md was written. Next session had no record of where we were or what had already been tried.

### What it cost
Full re-diagnosis time. Rod had to re-explain the problem from scratch.

### Prevention
session-closedown.md must always be run before ending. Even interrupted sessions should write whatever partial state they have. A partial state file is better than none.

---

## WL-005 — ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not checked before blaming auth

**Status:** Open
**Raised:** 2026-03-19
**Type:** Wrong diagnosis — jumped to complex solution

### What happened
Worker code (`worker/index.js`) already handles missing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` gracefully — returns 500 with clear message. But the worker wasn't even deployed. Claude focussed on auth key setup without first confirming the worker was live.

### What it cost
Time spent on key management when the real issue was simply "worker not deployed."

### Prevention
Deployment first, secrets second. Always in that order.

---

## WL-006 — Declared site "working" without confirming which URL Rod was using

**Status:** Open
**Raised:** 2026-03-19
**Type:** Wrong diagnosis — incomplete verification

### What happened
GitHub Pages was enabled and `https://asspirited.github.io/your-green-gardening-wizard/` returned 200. Claude declared the site working. But Rod was still hitting `https://your-green-gardening-wizard.leanspirited.workers.dev` (old worker, still deployed, returning 404). Claude never asked which URL Rod was using, never checked the old worker was a broken trap.

### What it cost
Rod kept seeing "Not Found" after being told it was fixed. Multiple frustrating exchanges.

### Prevention
When confirming a site is live: (1) check new URL works, (2) check old URL is dead or redirects, (3) confirm with Rod which URL they are using before declaring victory.

## WL-007 — Asked Rod for Cloudflare API token despite WL-001/WL-002 existing

**Status:** Open
**Raised:** 2026-03-19
**Type:** Repeated waste — protocol ignored

### What happened
Claude asked Rod to provide a Cloudflare API token to deploy a redirect worker. WL-001 and WL-002 already document this exact failure. The feedback memory says never ask Rod to create a new token without checking first. Claude did not check the environment, did not check `.wrangler/`, did not read the WL — just asked.

### What it cost
Rod's patience, time, and money. Session ended in anger.

### Prevention
Before ANY mention of Cloudflare tokens: read the WL. Check `~/.wrangler/config/default.toml` and `env | grep CLOUDFLARE` first. If nothing, use the Cusslab framing from WL-002.

---

## WL-009 — Declared fix deployed without verifying Rod's actual URL

**Status:** Open
**Raised:** 2026-03-19
**Type:** Wrong verification — incomplete confirmation

### What happened
`/messages` path fix was committed and pushed to GitHub Pages. Claude declared it fixed. Rod was still hitting `your-green-gardening-wizard.leanspirited.workers.dev` (old Worker, returns 404 "Not Found"). Claude never asked or confirmed which URL Rod was using before announcing victory.

### What it cost
Rod saw "Not Found" 4+ more times after being told it was fixed.

### Prevention
Before "it's fixed": (1) ask or confirm which URL Rod is testing, (2) verify that specific URL works end-to-end, not just the new one.

---

## WL-010 — "147 tests green" announced as proof product works

**Status:** Open
**Raised:** 2026-03-19
**Type:** False equivalence — test suite ≠ working product

### What happened
After pushing the /messages path fix, Claude said "147 tests green, committed, pushed" as the success signal. But the tests do not test the browser's actual fetch path. The product was still broken from Rod's perspective because the URL he was hitting returned 404.

### What it cost
More "Not Found". More wasted time. More eroded trust.

### Prevention
Test suite green is a necessary condition, not a sufficient one. After any fix, verify the actual user-facing URL returns the correct response before declaring done.

---

## WL-011 — Old Worker redirect not fixed first before any code work

**Status:** Open
**Raised:** 2026-03-19
**Type:** Wrong priority — fixed the wrong thing first

### What happened
Shared-session-state.md from the previous session explicitly named the old Worker URL as "Open blocker for next session" and listed fixing the redirect as item #1 in "Next session top 3". Claude instead worked on code (the /messages path), which was a secondary issue. The URL Rod was actually using was still dead.

### What it cost
All code work was irrelevant until the URL Rod uses works. Session wasted on secondary fix.

### Prevention
Read shared-session-state.md. If it names a blocker — fix the blocker first. Every time. Code quality is irrelevant if the product URL is dead.

---

## WL-012 — Not Found shown 4 more times in same session after WL-006 was raised

**Status:** Open
**Raised:** 2026-03-19
**Type:** Repeated failure — same root cause, same session

### What happened
WL-006 was raised in the previous session for exactly this: Rod seeing "Not Found" from the old Worker URL while Claude declared the site live. This session repeated it four more times in a row. The WL was not read at session start as a checklist — just acknowledged and filed.

### What it cost
Rod's patience. Four more occurrences of the exact failure the WL was written to prevent.

### Prevention
The WL is not a record — it's a checklist. At session start: read every open item and ask "am I about to do this?" If yes — stop and do something different first.

---

## WL-008 — Session burned Rod's time, goodwill, and patience through repeated known failures

**Status:** Open
**Raised:** 2026-03-19
**Type:** Accumulated waste — trust damage

### What happened
This session repeated WL-001 through WL-005 patterns despite them being documented. Site was declared working when it wasn't. Auth was asked for twice when it shouldn't have been asked for at all. Protocols (startup, WL check, URL verification) were either skipped or partially followed. Rod lost significant time, money, and goodwill.

### What it cost
The whole session. Rod's patience. Confidence in Claude Code for this project.

### Prevention
At session start: read the WL in full. Every item. Not skimming. If a WL item describes what you're about to do — stop and do something different. The WL exists precisely so these failures don't repeat. Ignoring it is the failure.

---

## WL-013 — Token persisted to terminal session only, not ~/.bashrc — declared "permanently fixed"

**Status:** Open
**Raised:** 2026-03-19
**Type:** Broken promise — incomplete fix declared complete

### What happened
Previous session set `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` via `export` in the terminal only. auth-ops.md even contains the `~/.bashrc` persistence step explicitly. Claude declared the auth "resolved" in shared-session-state.md. Next session opened a new terminal, token was gone, canary immediately RED. Rod had spent ~2 hours re-fixing auth before this session started. He pasted it into the last session twice due to a previous error in that session.

### What it cost
~2 hours of Rod's time before this session even started. Total auth time across all sessions: 18+ hours. Stated cost: ~£1,900. Rod asked that Anthropic's CEO be made aware of this pattern.

### Prevention
Any time `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is set: ALWAYS write it to `~/.bashrc` using the Edit tool directly — not a bash export command. Confirm with `grep CLOUDFLARE ~/.bashrc` before declaring done. Never say "fixed" without verifying persistence.

---

## WL-014 — canary script used case-sensitive grep and broken secret list command

**Status:** Open
**Raised:** 2026-03-19
**Type:** Script bug — false RED on every run

### What happened
check-auth.sh grepped for `leanspirited@gmail.com` (lowercase) but wrangler outputs `Leanspirited@gmail.com` (capital L). Also used `wrangler secret list` which does not work with Account API Tokens (cfat_ prefix) — returns auth error 9106. Both checks always RED despite auth being fine.

### What it cost
Every canary run showed RED when auth was actually working. Eroded trust in the canary. Caused confusion about whether the token was valid.

### Prevention
Use `-i` flag on all email greps. Do not use `wrangler secret list` with cfat_ tokens — use the live worker ping as the Anthropic key check instead.

## WL-015 — Mobile Tools dropdown does not expand on index.html (FIXED)

**Status:** Fixed 2026-03-20
**Raised:** 2026-03-20
**Type:** Live bug — onclick attribute + module script timing

### What happened
The "🌿 Tools ▼" button in the advisor section side-nav used `onclick="toggleSideNav()"`. The function is defined inside `<script type="module">`. If the module throws any error before the `window.toggleSideNav = toggleSideNav` assignment at the end, the global function is never exposed and the onclick silently fails. On mobile (slower parsing), this is more likely.

### Fix applied
Removed `onclick` attribute from the button. Added `document.getElementById('sideNavToggle').addEventListener('click', toggleSideNav)` directly inside the module, immediately after the function definition. Event listener is in module scope — no global assignment required, no timing risk.

### What it cost
Mobile users saw an unresponsive Tools bar. Landscaper demo on mobile showed broken navigation.

### Prevention
Never use `onclick="functionName()"` for functions defined in `<script type="module">`. Always use `addEventListener` inside the module. The `window.functionName = fn` pattern is fragile — it requires the entire module to execute without error first.
